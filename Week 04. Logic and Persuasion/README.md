**Logic and Persuasion: Tools of Leadership**

# **Student preparation for Week IV**

- Read the material in the Readings section below before class
- Update your Leadership Journal with specific commentary about your experience having to persuade someone or some group to your way of thinking:

 

1. What was the context (personal, family, business, church, other)?
2. What was the basis of your appeal to have others follow you?
3. What worked and what did not work in bringing people to your point of view?
4. What did people decide to do and why?
5. What would you do differently if facing the same situation today?  Why?
