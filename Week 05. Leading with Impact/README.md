**Week V**

**Leading with Impact**

# **Student preparation for Week V**

- Read the material in the Readings section below before class
- Update your Leadership Journal with specific commentary about your experience in leadership situations:

 

1. What was the context (personal, family, business, church, other)?
2. Was your leadership effective? Why or Why not?
3. What did you do to be effective? OR What did you not do that detracted from effectiveness?
4. How would you approach leading that situation in the future?
5. What would you do differently if facing the same situation today?  Why?

 

- Be prepared to engage in active class discussion using the readings and your own knowledge and experience as supporting examples and evidence. ANY leadership experience – from parenting to executive leadership – is valid material
