**Week VII**

**Character and Ethics**

# **Student preparation for Week VII**

- Read the material in the Readings section below before class.
- Please watch the full-length movie; “The Insider,” the 1999 film about the corporate executive who blew the lid off of the tobacco industry’s misinformation about the health effects of tobacco. Would you have been able to do what he did?
- Update your Leadership Journal with specific commentary about your experience in or perception of a challenging ethical dilemma that you faced or that you witnessed:

 

1. How do you define ethics? Ethical issues?
2. What is the difference between ethics, morals, and legality?
3. How would you characterize an ethical dilemma?
4. Was the ethical perspective shared by others?
5. How did you determine that ethics were at issue?
6. How would you approach leading that situation in the future?
7. What would you do differently if facing the same situation today?  Why?
8. How does your psychometric profile influence how you perceive ethical dilemmas?

 

- Be prepared to engage in active class discussion using the readings and your own knowledge and experience as supporting examples and evidence. ANY leadership experience – from parenting to executive leadership – is valid material

# **Learning Objectives**

1. Appreciate the distinction between moral, ethical, value, and legal issues
