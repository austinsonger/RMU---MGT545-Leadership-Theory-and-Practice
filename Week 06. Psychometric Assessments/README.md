### WEEK 6 - PSYCHOMETRIC ASSESSMENTS

**Week VI**

**Psychometric Assessments**

# **Student preparation for Week VI**

- Take the assessment examinations in the Readings section below before class
- Update your Leadership Journal with specific commentary about your experience concerning the take and interpretation of these tests:

 

1. What did you find most surprising?
2. What strengths do you bring to leadership?
3. What areas of risk should you be aware of in your own profile as it relates to being an effective leader?
4. What kinds of team members should you be sure to ally with to make an effective team?
5. Absent these formal psychometric profiles, how can one assess the contributions of team members?
6. If there is not enough talent on your team to offset your weakness or risk, what will you do to compensate? How will you implement the offset?
7. What are some of the ethical dilemmas posed by reliance on assessments?
8. How comfortable would you be if a decision to hire you or add you to a team were based largely on your test results?

 

- Be prepared to engage in active class discussion using the readings and your own knowledge and experience as supporting examples and evidence. ANY leadership experience – from parenting to executive leadership – is valid material

Please use the link below to access the Myer/Briggs assessment.

The assessment will take about 20 minutes.   Please be as honest as you can be.  As there are no right or wrong answers, trying to outguess the assessment will not provide an accurate assessment of your personal leadership style.    The assessment will give you an insight into what about your style works well and what could be looked at to enhance your style.  We will be using the assessment in week 6 but completing it before week 5 will enable you to get a good look at it before class.   After the assessment, I need to go into the system and release the results to you.   I will do that every morning, so expect it to take up to 24 hours to receive your report.    Should you decide to do the report just before class  YOU WILL NOT HAVE YOUR RESULTS FOR CLASS.
