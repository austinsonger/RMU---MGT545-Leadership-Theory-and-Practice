**Week VIII**

**Principled Leadership**

# **Student preparation for Week VIII**

- Read the material in the Readings section below before class
- Update your Leadership Journal with specific commentary about the value of PRINCIPLES in leadership situations. A principle is “a fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation for a system of belief or behavior or for a chain of reasoning.” What are the implications of principles for engaging leadership situations?
- B. Charles Ames was an outstanding CEO of three multi-billion-dollar companies (Reliance Electric, Acme-Cleveland, Uniroyal Goodrich). His “Straight Talk” memo was a set of leadership principles he carried with him from company to company. *Ames knew in advance how he would lead before he set foot inside a company.* 

1. What are the “fundamental truths” that underlie Ames’ leadership approach?
2. What does this tell you about effective leadership in different settings?
3. Do you think Ames is “demanding?” Why or why not?
4. Do you think Ames is “abusive?” Why or why not?
5. Would you want to work for a supervisor like Charles Ames? Why or why not?

 

- Be prepared to engage in active class discussion using the readings and your own knowledge and experience as supporting examples and evidence. ANY leadership experience – from parenting to executive leadership – is valid material
